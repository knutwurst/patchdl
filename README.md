## Highlights

- **Your whole library at a glance.** Every installed game shows up with its version and the newest update Sony offers for it.
- **Update all.** One click queues every game that has an update. PatchDL works through the queue and installs each update as soon as it lands.
- **Fast downloads.** Up to 16 parallel connections per update. Change the number in Settings while a download runs.
- **Survives reboots.** Pause, resume, or lose power: PatchDL saves progress after every finished piece and continues where it stopped.
- **Made for your firmware.** You only see updates your console can run, so no game ends up asking for newer system software.
- **Checked against Sony's checksums.** Turn on verification and PatchDL compares every piece with the SHA-256 Sony publishes for it.
- **A tile on your home screen.** One toggle adds PatchDL to the PS5 home screen. Tap it and the UI opens in the console's browser.
- **Live progress.** A banner at the top shows the current game, speed, time left and where you are in the queue.

## Fits any screen

Start an update from the couch with your phone, check on it from your laptop, or open it on the TV. The UI adapts to whatever screen it's on.

## Get started

1. Download `patchdl_<version>.elf` from the [latest release](https://github.com/knutwurst/patchdl/releases/latest).
2. Send it to your PS5 with the ELF loader you already use.
3. A notification on the TV shows the address, for example `http://192.168.0.42:12880/`. Open it in any browser on your network.
4. Optional: switch on **Home-screen shortcut** in Settings to get the PatchDL tile.

**You need** a PS5 that can load ELF payloads. PatchDL is tested on firmware 11.60.

## Good to know

**Does PatchDL download games?**
No. It fetches updates for games that are already installed on your console. Nothing else.

**Where do the updates come from?**
From Sony's official update servers, the same files your console downloads on its own. PatchDL only talks to a short list of PlayStation CDN hosts.

**Does it change the updates?**
No. Each package stays exactly as Sony published it, and the console's own installer applies it.

**Will it touch my system software?**
No. PatchDL never downloads system software, and it only offers game updates that run on the firmware you have.

**What about disc games?**
Put the disc in, same as with any update.

**What happens if the power goes out?**
Start PatchDL again and press Resume. Finished pieces stay on disk.
